Term,Definition
Branch,"A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the ""live"" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes."
Clone,"A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online."
Collaborator,A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.
Commit,"A commit, or ""revision"", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the ""SHA"" or ""hash"") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made."
Commit ID,Also known as SHA. A 40-character checksum hash that identifies the commit.
Commit message,"Short, descriptive text that accompanies a commit and communicates the change the commit is introducing."
Default Branch,"The base branch for new pull requests and code commits in a repository. Each repository has at least one branch, which Git creates when you initialize the repository. The first branch is usually called main, and is often the default branch."
Diff,"A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit."
Directory,A folder containing one or more files or folders. You can create directories to organize the contents of a repository.
Force push,A Git push that overwrites the remote repository with local changes without regard for conflicts.
Main,"The default development branch. Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named main is created, and becomes the active branch. In most cases, this contains the local development, though that is purely by convention and is not required."
Master,"The default branch in many Git repositories. By default, when you create a new Git repository on the command line, a branch called master is created. Many tools now use an alternative name for the default branch. For example, when you create a new repository on GitHub, the default branch is called main."
Merge,"Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a ""pull request"" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line."
Private Repository,Private repositories are only visible to the repository owner and collaborators that the owner specified.
Public Repository,"A public repository can be viewed by anyone, including people who aren't GitHub users."
Pull,"Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch."
Pull Request,"Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum."
Push,"To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them."
Push a branch,"When you successfully push a branch to a remote repository, you update the remote branch with changes from your local branch."
README,"A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you share expectations and manage contributions to your project."
Repository,"A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private."
SSH Key,"SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information to your computer."
